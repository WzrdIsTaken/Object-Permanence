Notes:
- mention unity was the right tool for the job in writeup/portfolio
- can defo talk about this dynamic stuff in writeup / video
	- have to use dyanmic because component doesnt have enabled and then different components implmenet it ???
		- eg see box collider vs transform
		- see the description i left in permanencecomponent
	- component is not a dynamic object , so have to use reflection

Tasks:
* Long Term:
- 

* General:
- Reorganise files? Got a managers folder with lots of debug stuff in it... and stuff in level
- And reorganise the models stuff etc. Got those oculos folders
- Do we want/need URP?
- Add new input stuff for DebugConsole

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pVdiBogmew&list=PLpEoiloH-4eP-OKItF8XNJ8y8e1asOJud&index=5
  at the end of the video mentioned had tutorial about a shader for the teleporation effect?
- Fix that the hand still squeezes when teleports?

- We might well use the new input system for the vr stuff. if we do this, refactor the player etc and also the debug console. it works in zipzap

- Add logic for the player 'death' / a key to reset the scene
- Then VR! ^ This is the final stuff we need to do for game logic.

- Idk if we need it but there is a Renderer.shadowCastingMode. I think its fine, but do we need to set it on/off in ComponentUtils?
	- If so, log / check what the default mode is... I'm guessing its just "on"
		- AH yeah, it was: can we detect if the camera can see an objects shadow, because if so it shouldnt be disabled?

- singleton constructor called twice?
- im sure we did an init list type thing in telekensis project..

Archive:
- Pull in navmesh and create an enemy which just moves towards the player.
- player movement probs
- reorganise code files (not very well organised atm)
- add way to enable/disables objects
- organise this file
