Notes:
- mention unity was the right tool for the job in writeup/portfolio
- can defo talk about this dynamic stuff in writeup / video
	- have to use dyanmic because component doesnt have enabled and then different components implmenet it ???
		- eg see box collider vs transform
		- see the description i left in permanencecomponent
	- component is not a dynamic object , so have to use reflection

- IF the vr headset look movement randomly starts inverting for some reason, go to the XR Origin gameobject in the test vr scene
  and copy the "TrackedPoseDriver" component on the its camera. Paste these values onto the vr player
- IF we want to teleport, then we have to have the CharacterControllerDriver component on our gameobject. But that causes other issues. 
  So perhaps just no tp? It might break the game in other ways anyway..?

Tasks:
* Long Term:
- Mechanic idea: Have mirrors/cameras which 'see' items so they don't deactivate. Could also be a mirrored ball or something the player holds?

* General:
- Do we want/need URP? YES, we added it, just got to follow some other steps to make it look good.

	- https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/17lbhjp/my_simple_vr_project_runs_at_around_200fps_when/ [ so far, turned off SSAO]

- the wall mechanic is still slighty buggy... see if we can fix? just change the param?
- and the boulders when you look away and they are eg mid falling off. you can also push them around while looking away?
	- fix up these bugs. we want a polished little demo
	- The latter can be fixed when just a change in lv design

- Make sure you can pick up / place cameras ok
- And pick up all the cubes in VR

- Add a sound effect when you turn around and see an enemy for the first time or something? :D

- To make a menu for our VR game see https://youtu.be/yhB921bDLYA?list=PLpEoiloH-4eP-OKItF8XNJ8y8e1asOJud&t=431

- Got a small bug, when you are holding an object you can move it with right controller stick up/down. but this is also turn (left and right)
	- So its easy to accidently press the wrong thing

  at the end of the video mentioned had tutorial about a shader for the teleporation effect?
- Fix that the hand still squeezes when teleports?

- We are just disabling gravity atm to stop the character falling through the floor. Hoesntly this is ok I think. I wont have jumping anyway, 
  and I'll just make the levels in such a way you can't fall off stuff..?
	- Facing the same problem with slopes though. and we NEED slopes

- Current bugs / todos:
	- Add the observer component to the vr player
	- Add the teleportation surface to the surfaces and interactable objects to the camera and cubes and stuff
	- Make sure everything works in the little scene

	- Tbh, it doesnt really matter if we never get things working as good as we want in vr, cos the stuff we will be recording
	  will just be in the editor or a flat screen build.

	- Then block out a short level.
	- Then test that, add a little menu and see (see "To make a menu for our VR game see [link]"), then done!
	- Write the report


- Idk if we need it but there is a Renderer.shadowCastingMode. I think its fine, but do we need to set it on/off in ComponentUtils?
	- If so, log / check what the default mode is... I'm guessing its just "on"
		- AH yeah, it was: can we detect if the camera can see an objects shadow, because if so it shouldnt be disabled?

Archive:
- Fix the vr player not being able to go up slopes / gravity problems. Why is this even happening? Do some more googling idk
		- If worst comes to worst, instead of the continous move provider can we just rewire our player move script to use other inputs?
			- Honestly, maybe try this first
				- If worst comes to absolute worth, just see if we can have a really shallow slope, or just have no slopes :p
- singleton constructor called twice? [not wo
- im sure we did an init list type thing in telekensis project.. rth it]
- Add in the enemy to the blockout level
- Make the player a bit smaller xd
- Add logic for the player 'death' / a key to reset the scene
- Add logic for the player 'death' / a key to reset the scene
- Reorganise files? Got a managers folder with lots of debug stuff in it... and stuff in level
- We might well use the new input system for the vr stuff. if we do this, refactor the player etc and also the debug console. it works in zipzap
- And reorganise the models stuff etc. Got those oculos folders
- Add new input stuff for DebugConsole
- Pull in navmesh and create an enemy which just moves towards the player.
- player movement probs
- reorganise code files (not very well organised atm)
- add way to enable/disables objects
- organise this file
