Notes:
- mention unity was the right tool for the job in writeup/portfolio
- can defo talk about this dynamic stuff in writeup / video
	- have to use dyanmic because component doesnt have enabled and then different components implmenet it ???
		- eg see box collider vs transform
		- see the description i left in permanencecomponent
	- component is not a dynamic object , so have to use reflection

Tasks:
* Long Term:
- Mechanic idea: Have mirrors/cameras which 'see' items so they don't deactivate. Could also be a mirrored ball or something the player holds?

* General:
- Add in the enemy to the blockout level
- Make the player a bit smaller xd

- Do we want/need URP? YES, we added it, just got to follow some other steps to make it look good.

- the wall mechanic is still slighty buggy... see if we can fix? just change the param?
- and the boulders when you look away and they are eg mid falling off. you can also push them around while looking away?
	- fix up these bugs. we want a polished little demo

  at the end of the video mentioned had tutorial about a shader for the teleporation effect?
- Fix that the hand still squeezes when teleports?

- Add logic for the player 'death' / a key to reset the scene
- Then VR! ^ This is the final stuff we need to do for game logic.

- Idk if we need it but there is a Renderer.shadowCastingMode. I think its fine, but do we need to set it on/off in ComponentUtils?
	- If so, log / check what the default mode is... I'm guessing its just "on"
		- AH yeah, it was: can we detect if the camera can see an objects shadow, because if so it shouldnt be disabled?

- singleton constructor called twice?
- im sure we did an init list type thing in telekensis project..

Archive:
- Reorganise files? Got a managers folder with lots of debug stuff in it... and stuff in level
- We might well use the new input system for the vr stuff. if we do this, refactor the player etc and also the debug console. it works in zipzap
- And reorganise the models stuff etc. Got those oculos folders
- Add new input stuff for DebugConsole
- Pull in navmesh and create an enemy which just moves towards the player.
- player movement probs
- reorganise code files (not very well organised atm)
- add way to enable/disables objects
- organise this file
