Notes:
- mention unity was the right tool for the job in writeup/portfolio
- can defo talk about this dynamic stuff in writeup / video
	- have to use dyanmic because component doesnt have enabled and then different components implmenet it ???
		- eg see box collider vs transform
		- see the description i left in permanencecomponent
	- component is not a dynamic object , so have to use reflection
